		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<img class="main-img" src= "assets/images/me.jpg">
		
		<p>I was Born December 26 1987 in San Antonio Tx, and grew up about 20 miles north In New Braunfels Tx. Home to the original Schlitterban Waterpark. I graduated from New Braunfels High School in 2006. I have a dog name Whitey and two cats named Fat Girl and Snickers. I currently a student at The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. In my spare time I refinish furniture and sell it on Craiglist or one of the local area apps like 5mile. I tend to be a bit of a homebody and tv matrathon junkie. Some of my favorite shows include Game of Thrones, Dexter, Last Man Standing, and Supernatural. As you can see from my bio pic I got to meet Jared Padalecki on 6th street (I think I played it cool "In my head!!") I'm and old soul at heart. My main genre is classic rock. Some of my favorites include Pinkfloyd, Allmen Brothers, CSN and sometimes Y, and White Snake 'Love me some power ballads'; but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac. I was got to see them in concert two years ago in Dallas. I would have seen them in Austin but the only tickets they still had available were $600. That's a little steep for me.</p>
